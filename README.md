# relapse

## Origin Story

This repo was born when "version control" stopped being a lifestyle choice and started being a coping mechanism. The first symptom: a script that reverse-walks file batches by mtime, prints paths, tars them, copies them, runs `code2prompt`, and even draws a little terminal timeline of the damage. Because when you’re vibe coding at 2am, the only thing more consistent than your logic is your regret.

It started as a one-off hack in `docs/`, got renamed, sprouted commands, learned to filter docs vs code, and even got shamed for confusing the system `batch` command ("read job from file") with our own. Then it moved into a dotfiles folder where it could haunt future decisions.

So yeah: relapse is not about preventing the fall. It’s about making the fallout retrievable, auditable, and slightly less humiliating. Damage control for the wagonless.
